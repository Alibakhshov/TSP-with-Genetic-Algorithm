## Overview

This desktop application is built with PySide6 to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a Genetic Algorithm. The app provides an intuitive interface for users to input their data and find an optimal solution to the TSP.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm:** The app employs a Genetic Algorithm to find an optimal solution to the TSP.
- **Interactive Interface:** Users can easily input their TSP data and visualize the results through the interactive graphical interface.
- **Configurable Parameters:** The Genetic Algorithm parameters are configurable, allowing users to experiment with different settings.
- **Result Visualization:** The app displays the optimized route and relevant statistics to help users understand the solution.
